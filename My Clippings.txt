For some reason, they didn’t get their needs met from any prior encounters.

One struggle most of us have as we try to serve our audience is the guilt sometimes associated with getting them to pay you. There are two reasons it’s essential to THEIR success that they pay you. First, those who pay, pay attention. Over the last decade, I’ve invited my friends or family members to sit in on events that others have paid $25,000 to attend. Not once in those 10 years has a single one of those people who sat in for free launched a successful company. Yet in the SAME room sat people who

Second, the more success you have, the less time you will have. I remember when I first started, how proud I was that I answered all my customer support emails and talked (often for hours) to everyone who asked me a question. I thought I was serving my audience, but because of how accessible I was to everyone, I wasn’t able to serve many people at all.

Sometimes they just want to be part of a community. Sometimes they just want to get to know you. Some people love to consume and learn, and that’s how they feel they get value. We can’t push our definition of value on them. We have to allow them to feel that in the way THEY define.

For example, I’ve seen statements that say something like: If I can make people believe that (cutting calories and exercising) is the key to (losing weight) and is only attainable through (my new weight loss course), then all other objections and concerns become irrelevant and they have to give me money. That statement is NOT true. If the belief you are trying to give them is that they need to cut calories and exercise, there are a few problems. 1. You are NOT in the Prolific Zone—you are in the mainstream. 2. This is NOT a new opportunity. There are thousands of identical programs crowding the niche of “cutting calories and exercising”. 3. This is NOT a blue ocean. They could literally buy one of a hundred different products to satisfy the belief you created.

From that day forward, I was sold. I wrote out simple trial closes on note cards and put them around my desk. As I worked through my various presentations, every time I’d see a card, I’d use that trial close. Here are some examples of trial closes that I’ve used dozens of times in each of my presentations. • Are you ready to get started? • Are you all getting this? • Is this making sense? • Can you imagine if that happened to you? • Who here wants a free copy of __________? • Would you like to be our next case study? • You’ve heard them talk about this before, right? • Isn’t that cool? • Isn’t that exciting? • Am I right? • Can you see yourself doing __________? • I’m sure you’ve noticed this too, right? I could go on and on. It’s become ingrained in how I write and speak. You’ve seen me using trial closes throughout this book, haven’t you?

Money is Good: The goal is to get people to disassociate their fear about spending money with you. Money is a tool for exchange. You spend money to get something greater in return. So I want you to think about something for a minute. What is money? A lot of people have fear about money, and even bigger fears about spending money, but you need to understand that money is good. It’s just a tool that was created for exchange. Other than that, there is no real value in money. You can’t use it to stay warm, you can’t eat it, you can only trade it for something else that you want. Just think, everyone who exchanges money for something does it because they feel that what they are getting in exchange is greater than keeping the money or using it for something else. At least that’s what I expect when I buy something. I don’t actually know for sure until I do buy it and try it out, and can see the results.

Money Replenishes: The goal for this close is to help people realize that while each month money comes back, time does not, and if they’re not careful, they will run out of time. Do you think it’s okay to dip into your savings or leverage your credit and spend money you might not have to get started today? This is a serious question. Do you think it’s okay or not? Some people say yes and some say no. Let’s talk about this for a minute.

Every month, money replenishes, right? But this is the key—time does NOT replenish. It disappears. So you could go out and spend months or years of your valuable time to figure something out—but you will never get that time back. Instead, you could save that time and effort, because I’ve already spent it for you, and work directly with me instead. It will cost you money to get started, but that money will come back, whereas the time away from your family in trial and error is wasted effort and is gone forever.

Their Two Choices: The goal for this close is to help them realize they are crazy if they don’t invest with you today. The way I see it, you’ve got two choices. Your first option is to do nothing and not take this leap of faith (which is 100% risk free). Your second option is to pony up this tiny investment today (compared to all the value you’ll get in return) and just give it a shot. See if it’ll work for you. If it doesn’t—for whatever reason—you get your money back. There’s no risk. You have nothing to lose but the stress and headaches.
